# üõ°Ô∏è Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort

This repository contains the implementation of **Task 2: Network Intrusion Detection System** from a cybersecurity lab/project. The goal of this task is to **set up a network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS)** using **Snort** on **Ubuntu**, configure detection rules, monitor network traffic, and optionally visualize alerts.

---

## üìå Task Overview

> ‚úÖ **TASK 2**: Set up a Network Intrusion Detection System
>
> * Use tools like **Snort** or **Suricata**.
> * Configure detection rules and alerts.
> * Monitor traffic for **potential threats**.
> * Implement **response mechanisms**.
> * Optionally, visualize detected attacks using dashboards or logs.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Environment

* **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 or later
* **NIDS Tool**: Snort (v2 or v3)
* **Interface**: CLI (terminal-based)
* **Visualization**: Console output / log files

---

## üèóÔ∏è Snort Setup Instructions

### üîπ 1. Install Snort on Ubuntu

Update your packages and install Snort:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snort -y
```

During installation:

* Choose the appropriate **network interface** (e.g., `eth0`, `ens33`)
* Set your **HOME\_NET** (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)

Check your network interface with:

```bash
ip a
```

You can later edit Snort configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

Set:

```bash
ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
```

---

### üîπ 2. Configure Custom Detection Rules

Snort uses a rule-based detection system. Custom rules can be written in:

```bash
/etc/snort/rules/local.rules
```

Example: Alert for ICMP (ping) packets:

```snort
alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Ping Detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```

Make sure your `snort.conf` includes this rule file:

```bash
include $RULE_PATH/local.rules
```

---

### üîπ 3. Run Snort in IDS Mode

Use the following command to start Snort in alert (IDS) mode:

```bash
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
```

* `-A console`: show alerts in the console
* `-q`: quiet mode (suppresses startup messages)
* `-c`: use the configuration file
* `-i`: specify the interface

Then, try pinging any host (e.g., `ping 8.8.8.8`). If your rule is active, Snort will show:

```
[**] [1:1000001:1] ICMP Ping Detected [**]
```

---

### üîπ 4. Response Mechanism (Optional)

Snort itself is **passive**, but you can add scripts for **response actions** (like logging or alerts).

Sample script to log detections:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Intrusion Detected at $(date)" >> /var/log/snort_custom.log
```

You can monitor `/var/log/snort/alert` or trigger scripts using tools like `inotify` or `cron`.

---

### üîπ 5. Visualization (Optional)

For quick real-time viewing:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/snort/alert
```

For advanced dashboards, integrate Snort with:

* **Snorby** (web UI)
* **Sguil**
* **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana)

## üß™ Testing the NIDS

To verify Snort is working:

1. Start Snort in monitoring mode.
2. Generate traffic (e.g., `ping`, `nmap`).
3. Check terminal or alert log:

   ```
   [**] [1:1000001:1] ICMP Ping Detected [**]
   ```

You can also add more advanced rules (e.g., detecting port scans, HTTP requests, etc.).

## üìå Sample Rule Examples

| Type          | Rule                                  | Description              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| ICMP          | `alert icmp any any -> any any (...)` | Detect ping packets      |
| TCP Port Scan | `alert tcp any any -> any 80 (...)`   | Detect access to port 80 |
| UDP           | `alert udp any any -> any 53 (...)`   | Detect DNS traffic       |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Learnings

* Snort allows real-time packet analysis and alerting.
* Rule-based detection is powerful but requires tuning.
* Can be integrated into full **SIEM** systems for real-world deployments.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This task successfully demonstrates how to:

* Set up Snort on Ubuntu
* Write and test basic detection rules
* Monitor live network traffic
* Respond and visualize intrusion attempts

This NIDS can serve as a **first step in building a complete intrusion detection and prevention pipeline**.
